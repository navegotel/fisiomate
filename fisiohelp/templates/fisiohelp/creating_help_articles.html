<h2>Creating Help articles</h2>
<p>
    There are two ways to extend the documentation site: 
    writing a markdown file or a django template file.
    In bothe cases the file needs to be registered through
    the admin interface.
</p>
<h3>Adding markdown files</h3>
<p>
    In almost all cases writing documentation in markdown 
    is the preferred way. If you are unfamiliar with markdown
    have a look at the 
    <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" targe="_blank">
        Mardown Guid
    </a>.
    It is an easy and portable way to create rich text without
    having to worry about layout issues. 
</p>
<p>
    Markdown files are placed in a subdirectory of the doc directory
    which is configured in <code>settings.py</code>. The subdirectory
    name is the two-letter language code. Language codes are lowercase.
    Naming of the file is important, they should be lowercase with
    underscores (c-style) and en with an <code>.md</code> extension.
</p>
<h3>Adding template files</h3>
<p>
    Think twice before you create a django template for documentation
    purpose. You will have all the freedom of using html and all the
    power of the django template engine.
    But with great power comes great responsibility. You must be familiar
    with the django template syntax and bulma. The file should
    extend <code>base_help.html</code> and load the <code>static</code>
    extension. Your content should go in the <code>content</code> block.
    The page you are reading right now is a template document. This is
    meant as a sample, you would not write this type of documentation
    as a template but rather simply use markdown. Naming is the same
    as for markdown files but must end with <code>.html</code>. These files
    are placed in the template directory.
