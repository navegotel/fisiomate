# Setup

Fisiomate is a web application written in python using Django, 
therefore you need to have  python3 and Django installed.

It is highly recommended to set up a python virtual environment.
You can install the application anywhere you want although 
the best way probably is to create a specific user and group
called fisiomate and use the home directory for the setup.
